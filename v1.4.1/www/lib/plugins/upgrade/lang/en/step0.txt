This plugin will automatically upgrade your wiki to the newest available DokuWiki version. Before continuing, you should read the [[doku>changes|Changelog]] to check if there are any additional steps for you to perform before or after upgrading.

To allow automatic upgrading, the PHP process requires write permissions for Dokuwiki files. The plugin will check for the necessary file permissions before starting the upgrade process.

This plugin will not upgrade any installed plugins or templates.

We recommend that you create a backup of your wiki before continuing.
