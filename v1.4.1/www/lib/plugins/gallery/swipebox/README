This is a slightly modified version of the SwipeBox script available at  https://github.com/brutaldesign/swipebox.git

The modified sources are available at https://github.com/splitbrain/swipebox/tree/dokuwiki - only the src directory is included here.

css/swipebox.css has been renamed to css/swipebox.less to work with DokuWiki's less compiler inclusion mechanism

unneeded minified files have been removed

a 3rd party patch for jQuery 3 compatibility has been applied
