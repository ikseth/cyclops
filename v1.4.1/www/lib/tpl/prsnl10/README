  I. About

    "prsnl10" is a minimalist template for DokuWiki. It is designed to use
    DokuWiki as CMS for portfolio websites and other "non-wiki" purposes. The
    name means "personal template 2010" because it was created the personal
    website of Andreas Haerter [1] in 2010.

  II. Installation and update

    The installation works as described [1] on DokuWiki.org. Extract the
    downloaded archive into your DokuWiki's "lib/tpl/" folder. Then select the
    template in the Config Manager by adjusting the template option.

    See the prsnl10 template website for update instructions [2].

  III. Customizing the template

    In order to make updates of your installed "prsnl10" template easy, follow
    these hints for customizing the template:

    - Place your files in "prsnl10/user"
      The place to store *all* user-defined, custom stuff is the "prsnl10/user"
      directory because your files will not be touched or overwritten on
      template updates! So you normally can copy all new files into "prsnl10/"
      to update the template without loosing your changes.
      Note: There are example files helping you modifying the template.
            The are delivered with the ".dist" extensions. Just remove the
            ".dist" extension to use them.

    - Own logo
      If you want to replace the default logo showed in the upper left, simply
      create a "logo.[png|gif|jpg]" in "monobook/user". The template recognizes
      the file automatically and will use it instead of the default text.
      Note: Do not forget to empty your browser's cache if you cannot see any
            effect.
      Hint: If you want to use a text-based logo, you might find the font
            files [1] for "Droid Sans" out of Google's Webfont Directory [2]
            useful.

    - Own favicon
      If you want to replace the default favicon, simply create a "favicon.ico"
      in "prsnl10/user". The template recognizes the file automatically and
      will use it instead of the default one. You might find the online FavIcon
      Generator [3] useful.
      Note: "favicon.png" is also possible but not recommended (because it is
            not supported by older MSIE versions).

    - Own CSS
      To apply additional CSS rules, create a
        - "prsnl10/user/screen.css" file to influence the normal layout. You
          can rename the "screen.css.dist" to "screen.css" as starting point.
        - "prsnl10/user/print.css" file to influence the print layout. You
          can rename the "print.css.dist" to "print.css" as starting point.
        - "prsnl10/user/rtl.css" file to influences "right-to-left" languages
          like Hebrew. You can rename the "rtl.css.dist" to "rtl.css" as
          starting point.
      The file(s) will be included automatically (as the last ones for the
      relevant media, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles).
      Note: Do not forget to empty your browser's cache if you cannot see any
            effect.

    - Own JavaScript
      To load additional JavaScript, create a "prsnl10/user/user.js" file. You
      can rename the "user.js.dist" to "user.js" as starting point (it contains
      some examples and useful comments how to define your own JavaScript).
      ATTENTION: You have to activate the template option "prsnl10_loaduserjs"
                 (->"Load 'prsnl10/user/user.js'?") in the DokuWiki Config
                 Manager!

    - Web analytics software (Piwik, Google Analytics etc.)
      Tools like Piwik and Google Analytics normally provide a small code
      snippet ("tag") which you have to include at your website to make
      everything work. If you want to use such software with this template,
      create a "prsnl10/user/tracker.php.dist". You don't have to deliberate
      where you have to copy and  paste the code, simply do it there. You can
      rename the "tracker.php.dist" to "tracker.php" as a good starting point
      (it contains some examples and useful comments how to define your own
      boxes).

    - Own Apple Touch Icon
      If you want to replace the default Apple Touch Icon, simply create a
      "apple-touch-icon.png" in "prsnl10/user". The template recognizes the file
      automatically and will use it instead of the default one. Have a look at
      Apple's developer database (cf. "Configuring Web Applications" [4]) if you
      need more information.

  VIII. Creation transcript

    Some developers may find this interesting. Additionally, I am very oblivious
    :-P.

    In principle, I followed my own tutorial [1]. There was just no "starter"
    template [2] when "prsnl10" was created. Therefore, after ~1 year, I
    switched the CSS base from DokuWiki's default template to the starter
    template, but the markup of "main.php" is still based on the default
    template's "main.php".
