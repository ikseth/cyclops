===== Recolocar recursos Pacemaker =====

  - Para recolocar recursos en el nodo preferido ejecutamos el siguiente comando desde el nodo activo:
<code>
 haresl relocatorigin
</code>

<hidden Resultado>
<code>
[root@[MANAGEMENT NODES] ~]# haresl relocatorigin

Please wait a few seconds ...

All needed relocate requests (for running resources) have been issued to Pacemaker.
But it could take a while (between 5 and 300s) for relocations to be completed.
Therefore, check in the next minutes that the resources have successfully been relocated with the command :
"haresl listprefs" or "haadml show"
